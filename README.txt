 * CPU: 32 or 64 bit, SSE2 support
 * RAM: 50-200 MB, depending on buffer size

On Linux, the "libxcb", "libxcb-render", and "libcairo" libraries, and either
the "kdialog" or the "zenity" application are required to run JS80P. To install
them on Debian based distributions (e.g. Ubuntu), you can use the following
command:

    sudo apt-get install libxcb1 libxcb-render0 libcairo2 zenity kdialog

Installation
------------

1. Download JS80P from its website at https://attilammagyar.github.io/js80p
2. Extract the ZIP archive.
3. Depending on which plugin type you downloaded, copy "js80p.dll" on Windows,
   or "js80p.so" on Linux to the folder where you keep your VST 2.4 plugins,
   or copy "js80p.vst3" to your VST 3 folder.

The "presets" folder in the archive contains a few sounds that you can load by
clicking the Import Patch icon near the top left corner of the main screen of
the plugin.

Usage
-----

 * Move the cursor over a knob, and use the mouse wheel for adjusting its
   value, or start dragging it.

 * Hold down the Control key while adjusting a knob for fine grained
   adjustments.

 * Double click on a knob to reset it to its default value.

 * Click on the area below a knob to assign a controller to it.

 * It is recommended to use a small buffer size for lower latency, for example,
   3-6 milliseconds, or 128 or 256 samples at 44.1 kHz sample rate.
