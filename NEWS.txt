v2.2.0 (2023-10-03)
 * New parameter for the Chorus effect: switch between 15 different
   configurations, with up to 7 voices.
 * New parameter for the Reverb effect: switch between 10 different tunings.

v2.1.0 (2023-09-28)
 * Echo and Reverb now support side-chain compression: clean up the sound by
   reducing the volume of the wet signal while the dry signal is loud, and
   gradually bring up the wet signal once the dry signal goes below the
   threshold.
 * Multiple volume controls have been added to the effect chain. The one before
   the overdrive and distortion goes up to 200%, allowing the effects to be
   pushed really hard.
 * Signal peak levels at various points of the signal chain can now be used for
   controlling parameters and macros.

v2.0.3 (2023-09-24)
 * It is now possible to assign Macros to discrete parameters like Filter Types
   and Waveforms.
 * Memory and CPU consumption of delay based effects have been reduced, so they
   will no longer use the CPU when the synth is idle and all sounds have
   decayed.
 * Bugfix: fixed a bug with program name saving and loading in the FST plugin.

v2.0.2 (2023-09-16)
 * Documented how Envelopes work in the synth with regards to polyphony.
 * Reduced patch size and improved patch import and export performance by
   omitting redundant information from patches.
 * Improved responsivity of the FST plugin to host events (by requesting the
   "effIdle" message from the host) when the plugin's own window is closed or
   hidden.
 * Bugfix: fixed possible crashes in the FST plugin when using automation.

v2.0.1 (2023-09-10)
 * Flexible Controllers have been renamed to Macros.
 * Reduced RAM and CPU usage, especially when the plugin is idle.
 * Bugfix: fixed a problem in filter state handling which could lead to
   occasional signal discontinuities and glitches.
 * Bugfix: fixed a potential crash around GUI and audio engine communication.
 * Bugfix: the FST plugin sometimes switched to the blank preset while loading
   banks, saved projects, or when doing a preset change or MIDI program change.

v2.0.0 (2023-08-16)
 * Implemented monophonic mode for smooth legato playing
 * New preset: Monophonic Saw

v1.9.9 (2023-08-03)
 * Bugfix: initialize MIDI CC 64 (sustain pedal) to 0% instead of 50%. The
   basic sound of patches that utilize the sustain pedal (like some of the
   built-in presets) are usually designed with the pedal being released, so
   that's how they should sound when the plugin is used without one.

v1.9.8 (2023-07-29)
 * Bugfix: fixed logarithmic scale filter frequency persistency. When a
   logarithmic scale filter frequency parameter had no controller assigned to
   it, then patch save and load operations, and DAW project save and reopen
   operations caused the filter frequency to significantly drift upwards.

v1.9.7 (2023-07-22)
 * Build separate versions of the plugin for newer CPUs which support the AVX
   instruction set
 * Bugfix: make sure that the FST plugin always reports the short name of the
   current program correctly to the host application

v1.9.6 (2023-07-16)
 * Bugfix: when a note was immediately released after being triggered, it could
   happen that its parameters that were controlled by envelopes would start
   their release from the parameter's last set value instead of the envelope's
   initial value. Now if a note is released immediately after getting triggered
   then its parameters that have an envelope assigned to them will gradually
   change from the envelope's initial value to its final value.
 * Bugfix: the All Files option in file selector dialogs will actually show all
   files on Linux, not just the ones with a dot in their name.

v1.9.5 (2023-07-15)
 * 2 new presets: Nightmare Lead and Tremolo Lead
 * Bugfix: along with the release time, non-dynamic envelopes will also use the
   final value and amount that was in effect at the moment when the note was
   triggered, and only dynamic envelopes will update their final value and
   amount for already sounding notes

v1.9.4 (2023-07-14)
 * Bugfix: when the same note was triggered on multiple voices while holding
   down the sustain pedal, then releasing the pedal failed to release some
   of the voices, keeping the note ringing. Now these stuck notes are correctly
   released

v1.9.3 (2023-07-11)
 * Documentation clarifications and typo fixes
 * Improve VST 3 bundle compatibility with 32 bit hosts on Linux
 * Bugfix: reduce unwanted noise in the Overdrive and Distortion effects which
   became noticeable when the input signal was already rich in harmonics, and
   the distortion was cranked up to 11

v1.9.2 (2023-07-08)
 * Include more detailed, HTML documentation in distribution packages
 * Increase the effect of note velocity on the timbre of the Saw Piano and
   Saw Piano Reversed patches
 * Reduce CPU usage while collecting decayed voices
 * Bugfix: when the sustain pedal was released, occasionally a few notes would
   remain sounding, and sometimes notes could get released which should have
   remained sounding due to their corresponding key being held down. Now those
   and only those voices remain sounding after a pedal release which belong to
   held down keys

v1.9.1 (2023-07-05)
 * Voices which decay completely into silence during their envelope sustain
   phase are now turned off automatically, in order to be reused for new notes,
   and to save CPU time.
 * Bugfix: non-dynamic envelopes will use the release time that was in effect
   at the moment when the note was triggered, only dynamic envelopes will
   update the release time for already sounding notes
 * Bugfix: the FST plugin now handles the sustain pedal's messages correctly
   in FL Studio as well.

v1.9.0 (2023-07-04)
 * Sustain pedal is now supported
 * Sustain pedal can also be used to control parameters (e.g. it can adjust
   Envelopes via a Flexible Controller)
 * Presets are adjusted to take advantage of the sustain pedal as well
 * Polyphony increased to 64 voices
 * Include version, platform, and SDK version in the information shown on the
   About tab

v1.8.0 (2023-07-01)
 * 20 Flexible Controllers instead of 10, allowing more complex patches
 * Logarithmic Filter Frequencies toggle for the filters of delay-based effects
 * VST3: build legacy single file and bundle packages as well
 * FST: when program names need to be truncated, shorten the middle of the text
   instead of the end

v1.7.6 (2023-06-27)
 * Bugfix: in some host applications (e.g. energyXT, SAVIHost), the name of the
   current program was reported to the host application incorrectly by the FST
   plugin

v1.7.5 (2023-06-23)
 * increase the effect of the mod wheel and utilize the channel pressure
   (aftertouch) more in presets

v1.7.4 (2023-06-23)
 * make Envelope and Flexible Controller colors easier to distinguish
 * extend REAME.txt with usage tips
 * Bugfix: the delay time of the Chorus effect will no longer go outside the
   specified range

v1.7.3 (2023-06-18)
 * Highlight different controller types with different colors
 * New presets:
    * Ambient Pad 1
    * Ambient Pad 2
    * Ambient Pad 3
    * Saw Piano
    * Saw Piano Reversed

v1.7.2 (2023-06-17)
 * Bugfix: centered LFOs will now handle distortion and randomness correctly.

v1.7.1 (2023-06-17)
 * FST: reduce CPU usage of host UI parameter updates due to MIDI Control
   Change (CC) events

v1.7.0 (2023-06-16)
 * New effect: chorus
 * New preset: derezzed
 * Bugfix: LFO distortion and randomness now have effect again, and the min,
   max, amount, etc. range settings are respected.

v1.6.0 (2023-06-11)
 * Envelopes can now be configured to affect notes that are already sounding.
 * New presets:
    * Acid Lead 1
    * Acid Lead 2
    * Acid Lead 3
    * Bells 1
    * Bells 2
    * Flute
    * FM Womp 1
    * FM Womp 2
    * FM Womp 3
    * Tech Noir Lead 1
    * Tech Noir Lead 2
    * Tech Noir Lead 3
 * Bugfix: LFOs now respect min, max, amount, etc. range settings when
   distortion and randomness are in use.

v1.5.1 (2023-06-07)
 * Bugfix: eliminate noise in FL Studio when the delay time for the Echo effect
   is set to extremely low values (few milliseconds).

v1.5.0 (2023-06-06)
 * Improved MIDI CC smoothing
 * Parameters can now be controlled via Channel Aftertouch (Channel Pressure).
 * With the help of Patrik Ehringer (ZonderP), program and bank management is
   implemented, and presets are accessible via the host application, without
   having to browse the file system.
 * The FST plugin now exports its MIDI Control Change (MIDI CC) inputs as
   host-automatable parameters, just like the VST3 version does.
 * MIDI Learn now listens for changes in these new MIDI CC proxy parameters
   as well, which is useful for hosts that refuse to send the raw MIDI CC
   events to plugins, but allow automating parameters via MIDI CC. One
   example of such a host is FL Studio which only sends the modulation wheel's
   MIDI CC messages as actual MIDI CC data, and forces users to manually assign
   all other MIDI CC events to plugin parameters.
 * LFOs can now oscillate around the midpoint between the minimum and maximum
   value.
 * New presets: kalimba.js80p, chariots-aftertouch.js80p
 * Presets that have both pitch bends and vibrato now use LFO centering so that
   they won't go out of tune.
 * Bugfix: the VST3 plugin will now process all controller changes within a
   block, not just the last one
 * Bugfix: make sure that before a patch (or program or bank) is imported, all
   parameter controllers are released, and all scheduled parameter values are
   cleared, so that they will not override the imported values.
 * Bugfix: unlike the Fine Detune parameter, the Detune parameter should not
   be smoothed when it has a MIDI Controller or a Flexible Controller assigned
   to it.

v1.4.0 (2023-05-20)
 * MIDI Learn: assign this special controller to a parameter, then move a
   fader, knob, or the modulation wheel, etc. on your MIDI keyboard, and the
   plugin will automatically assign that controller to the parameter
 * Cutoff frequency of filters can now use logarithmic scale
 * LFO frequency and Echo time can now be synchronized to the host's tempo
 * New preset: sandstorm.js80p
 * Bugfix: include CC 6 (Data Entry) in controller selection, and remove CC 84
   (Portamento), since the latter is not supposed to represent a continuous
   controller
 * Bugfix: fix the typo in the name of the Distortion effect

v1.3.0 (2023-05-13)
 * The GUI will now indicate clearly when a parameter is fully controlled by
   an envelope
 * Bugfix: eliminate noise which occurs when FL Studio is running the plugin
   with variable buffer sizes and the Echo or Reverb effects are turned on
 * Bugfix: Reverb and Echo should not consume any CPU when Wet Volume is 0% and
   Dry Volume is 100%

v1.2.0 (2023-05-07)
 * Respond to ALL_NOTES_OFF and ALL_SOUNDS_OFF MIDI messages
 * Get rid of obtrusive tooltips on Windows, show long name of knobs in the
   top right corner of the window instead
 * New preset: chariots.js80p
 * Bugfix: make sure that all text files in the Windows distribution use
   Windows-style line breaks
 * Bugfix: fix libcairo2 crash when the plugin's window is closed and opened
   again repeatedly in quick succession on Linux
 * Bugfix: fix crash in the FST plugin when running in Ardour (and possibly
   other hosts) which sends and effEditIdle message before sending the first
   effEditOpen

v1.1.2 (2023-05-03)
 * Bugfix: don't block the host's user interface while the file picker dialog
   is open on Linux

v1.1.1 (2023-05-02)
 * Bugfix: opening the user interface of multiple plugin instances will no
   longer cause a crash when the instances are running within the same process
 * Bugfix: filter states will no longer interfere with each other between
   multiple plugin instances when running within the same process
 * Bugfix: when Reaper is started up with a project which was saved with an
   open "FX: Track N" window, JS80P will no longer fail to display its user
   interface on Linux

v1.1.0 (2023-05-01)
 * Linux support
 * Use warm colors for knobs which have associated controllers
 * Add the "System Requirements" section to README.txt
 * Bugfix: GUI updates will no longer flicker and interfere with editing knobs
