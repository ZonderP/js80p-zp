 * New presets:
    * Ambient Pad 1
    * Ambient Pad 2
    * Ambient Pad 3
    * Saw Piano
    * Saw Piano Reversed

v1.7.2 (2023-06-17)
 * Bugfix: centered LFOs will now handle distortion and randomness correctly.

v1.7.1 (2023-06-17)
 * FST: reduce CPU usage of host UI parameter updates due to MIDI Control
   Change (CC) events

v1.7.0 (2023-06-16)
 * New effect: chorus
 * New preset: derezzed
 * Bugfix: LFO distortion and randomness now have effect again, and the min,
   max, amount, etc. range settings are respected.

v1.6.0 (2023-06-11)
 * Envelopes can now be configured to affect notes that are already sounding.
 * New presets:
    * Acid Lead 1
    * Acid Lead 2
    * Acid Lead 3
    * Bells 1
    * Bells 2
    * Flute
    * FM Womp 1

    * Tech Noir Lead 2
    * Tech Noir Lead 3
 * Bugfix: LFOs now respect min, max, amount, etc. range settings when
   distortion and randomness are in use.

v1.5.1 (2023-06-07)
 * Bugfix: eliminate noise in FL Studio when the delay time for the Echo effect
   is set to extremely low values (few milliseconds).

v1.5.0 (2023-06-06)
 * Improved MIDI CC smoothing
 * Parameters can now be controlled via Channel Aftertouch (Channel Pressure).
 * With the help of Patrik Ehringer (ZonderP), program and bank management is
   implemented, and presets are accessible via the host application, without
   having to browse the file system.
 * The FST plugin now exports its MIDI Control Change (MIDI CC) inputs as
   host-automatable parameters, just like the VST3 version does.
 * MIDI Learn now listens for changes in these new MIDI CC proxy parameters
   as well, which is useful for hosts that refuse to send the raw MIDI CC
   events to plugins, but allow automating parameters via MIDI CC. One
   example of such a host is FL Studio which only sends the modulation wheel's
   MIDI CC messages as actual MIDI CC data, and forces users to manually assign
   all other MIDI CC events to plugin parameters.
 * LFOs can now oscillate around the midpoint between the minimum and maximum
   value.
 * New presets: kalimba.js80p, chariots-aftertouch.js80p
 * Presets that have both pitch bends and vibrato now use LFO centering so that
   they won't go out of tune.
 * Bugfix: the VST3 plugin will now process all controller changes within a
   block, not just the last one
 * Bugfix: make sure that before a patch (or program or bank) is imported, all
   parameter controllers are released, and all scheduled parameter values are
   cleared, so that they will not override the imported values.
 * Bugfix: unlike the Fine Detune parameter, the Detune parameter should not
   be smoothed when it has a MIDI Controller or a Flexible Controller assigned
   to it.

v1.4.0 (2023-05-20)
 * MIDI Learn: assign this special controller to a parameter, then move a
   fader, knob, or the modulation wheel, etc. on your MIDI keyboard, and the
   plugin will automatically assign that controller to the parameter
 * Cutoff frequency of filters can now use logarithmic scale
 * LFO frequency and Echo time can now be synchronized to the host's tempo
 * New preset: sandstorm.js80p
 * Bugfix: include CC 6 (Data Entry) in controller selection, and remove CC 84
   (Portamento), since the latter is not supposed to represent a continuous
   controller
 * Bugfix: fix the typo in the name of the Distortion effect

v1.3.0 (2023-05-13)
 * The GUI will now indicate clearly when a parameter is fully controlled by
   an envelope
 * Bugfix: eliminate noise which occurs when FL Studio is running the plugin
   with variable buffer sizes and the Echo or Reverb effects are turned on
 * Bugfix: Reverb and Echo should not consume any CPU when Wet Volume is 0% and
   Dry Volume is 100%

v1.2.0 (2023-05-07)
 * Respond to ALL_NOTES_OFF and ALL_SOUNDS_OFF MIDI messages
 * Get rid of obtrusive tooltips on Windows, show long name of knobs in the
   top right corner of the window instead
 * New preset: chariots.js80p
 * Bugfix: make sure that all text files in the Windows distribution use
   Windows-style line breaks
 * Bugfix: fix libcairo2 crash when the plugin's window is closed and opened
   again repeatedly in quick succession on Linux
 * Bugfix: fix crash in the FST plugin when running in Ardour (and possibly
   other hosts) which sends and effEditIdle message before sending the first
   effEditOpen

v1.1.2 (2023-05-03)
 * Bugfix: don't block the host's user interface while the file picker dialog
   is open on Linux

v1.1.1 (2023-05-02)
 * Bugfix: opening the user interface of multiple plugin instances will no
   longer cause a crash when the instances are running within the same process
 * Bugfix: filter states will no longer interfere with each other between
   multiple plugin instances when running within the same process
 * Bugfix: when Reaper is started up with a project which was saved with an
   open "FX: Track N" window, JS80P will no longer fail to display its user
   interface on Linux

v1.1.0 (2023-05-01)
 * Linux support
 * Use warm colors for knobs which have associated controllers
 * Add the "System Requirements" section to README.txt
 * Bugfix: GUI updates will no longer flicker and interfere with editing knobs
