<a name="linux-deps"></a>

### Dependencies on Linux

On Linux, the `libxcb`, `libxcb-render`, and `libcairo` libraries, and either
the `kdialog` or the `zenity` application are required to run JS80P. To install
them on Debian based distributions (e.g. Ubuntu), you can use the following
command:

    sudo apt-get install libxcb1 libxcb-render0 libcairo2 zenity kdialog

Note that if you want to run the 32 bit version of JS80P on a 64 bit system,
then you will have to install the 32 bit version of the libraries, for example:

    sudo apt-get install libxcb1:i386 libxcb-render0:i386 libcairo2:i386 zenity kdialog

<a name="install"></a>

Installation
------------

If your plugin host application does not support VST 3, but does support
VST 2.4, then you have to download and install the FST version of JS80P.
Otherwise, you should go with the VST 3 bundle on all supported operating
systems.

If your plugin host application fails to recognize JS80P from the VST 3 bundle,
then you have to download and install the VST 3 Single File version that
matches the CPU architecture for which your plugin host application was built.
(For example, some 32 bit (i686) versions of Reaper are known to be unable to
recognize VST 3 bundles when running on a 64 bit system.)

Frequenctly Asked Questions
---------------------------

<a name="faq-which"></a>

### Which distribution should I download?

If your plugin host application does not support VST 3, but does support
VST 2.4, then you have to download and install the FST version of JS80P.
Otherwise, you should go with the VST 3 bundle on all supported operating
systems.

If your plugin host application fails to recognize JS80P from the VST 3 bundle,
then you have to download and install the VST 3 Single File version that
matches the CPU architecture for which your plugin host application was built.
(For example, some 32 bit (i686) versions of Reaper are known to be unable to
recognize VST 3 bundles when running on a 64 bit system.)

The 32 bit versions are usually only needed by those who deliberately use a 32
bit plugin host application, e.g. because they want to keep using some really
old plugins which are not available for 64 bit systems.

If you are in doubt, then try the VST 3 bundle, and if your plugin host
application doesn't recognize it, then try the 64 bit VST 3 version, then the
64 bit FST version, then the 32 bit VST 3 version, and so on.

Note that all versions use the same high-precision sound synthesis engine
internally, so the CPU architecture does not affect the sound quality.

<a name="faq-mac"></a>

### Mac version?

Sorry, it's not likely to happen anytime soon, unless someone is willing to
create and maintain a Mac fork of JS80P. For me to do it, it would require
quite a large investment, both in terms of effort and financially. If MacOS
would be available (at a reasonable price) for installing it in a virtual
machine that could be used for testing, I'd consider that. But as long as it
cannot be obtained (legally) without also buying a Mac, and I'm happy with my
current computer, I'm not going to invest in a new one.

<a name="faq-custom-wave"></a>

### The knobs in the Custom Waveform harmonics secion don't do anything, is this a bug?

To hear the effect of those knobs, you have to select the _Custom_ waveworm
using the `WAV` knob in the top left corner of the Oscillator sections.

(Note that these parameters are CPU-intensive to process, so they are not
sample accurate, they are not smoothed, and they are processed only once for
each rendering block. Due to this, if you change them while a note is playing,
or assign a controller to them, then you might hear "steps" or even clicks.)

<a name="faq-automation"></a>

### How can parameters be automated? What parameters does the plugin export?

The intended way of automating JS80P's parameters is to assign a
[MIDI Control Change][midicc] (MIDI CC) message to a parameter (or use _MIDI
Learn_), and turn the corresponding knob on your MIDI keyboard while playing,
or edit the MIDI CC events in your host application's MIDI editor.

However, the VST 3 plugin format requires plugins to export a proxy parameter
for each MIDI CC message that they want to receive, and as a side-effect, these
parameters can also be automated using the host application's usual automation
editor. For the sake of consistency, the FST plugin also exports automatable
parameters for each supported MIDI CC message.

  [midicc]: https://www.midi.org/specifications-old/item/table-3-control-change-messages-data-bytes-2

For example, in both plugin types, you might assign the
`MIDI CC 1 (Modulation Wheel)` controller to the Phase Modulation (PM)
parameter of the synthesizer, and then add automation in the host application
to the `MIDI CC 1 (Modulation Wheel)` (VST 3) or `ModWh` (FST) parameter. JS80P
will then interpret the changes of this parameter the same way as if you were
turning the modulation wheel on a MIDI keyboard.

<a name="faq-flstudio-midicc"></a>

### How to assign a MIDI CC to a JS80P parameter in FL Studio?

Unlike decent audio software (like for example
[REAPER](https://www.reaper.fm/)), [FL Studio](https://www.image-line.com/fl-studio/)
does not send all MIDI events that come out of your MIDI keyboard to plugins,
and unfortunately, [MIDI Control Change (MIDI CC)][midicc2] messages are among
the kinds of MIDI data that it swallows. To make everything work, you have to
assign the MIDI CC events to a plugin parameter.

  [midicc2]: https://www.midi.org/specifications-old/item/table-3-control-change-messages-data-bytes-2

JS80P does not directly export its parameters (in order to avoid conflict
between the host's automations and JS80P's internal control assignments), but
it exports proxy parameters which represent MIDI CC messages that it handles.

For example, let's say a physical knob on your MIDI keyboard is configured to
send its values in `MIDI CC 7` messages. To make this knob turn the _Phase
Modulation (PM)_ virtual knob in JS80P, you have to do the following steps:

1. Click on the small triangle in the top left corner of the plugin window of
   JS80P, and select the "_Browse parameters_" menu item.

2. Find the parameter named "_Vol_" (FST) or "_MIDI CC 7 (Volume)_" (VST 3) in
   the browser. Click on it with the right mouse button.

3. Select the "_Link to controller..._" menu item.

4. Turn the knob on your MIDI keyboard until FL Studio recognizes it.

5. Now click on the area below the _Phase Modulation (PM)_ virtual knob in
   JS80P's interface.

6. Select either the "_MIDI CC 7 (Volume)_" option, or the "_MIDI Learn_"
   option, and turn the physical knob on your MIDI keyboard again.

<a name="faq-flstudio-aftertouch"></a>

### How to assign Channel Pressure (Aftertouch) to a JS80P parameter in FL Studio?

Unlike decent audio software (like for example
[REAPER](https://www.reaper.fm/)), [FL Studio](https://www.image-line.com/fl-studio/)
does not send all MIDI events that come out of your MIDI keyboard to plugins,
and unfortunately, Channel Pressure (also known as Channel Aftertouch)
messages are among the kinds MIDI data that it swallows.

Getting the Channel Pressure to work in FL Studio is a similar, but slightly
more complicated procedure than setting up MIDI CC:

1. Click on the small triangle in the top left corner of the plugin window of
   JS80P, and select the "_Browse parameters_" menu item.

2. Press a piano key on your MIDI keyboard, and hold it down without triggering
   aftertouch.

3. While holding the piano key down, find the parameter named "_Ch AT_" (FST)
   or "_Channel Aftertouch_" (VST 3) in FL Studio's browser. Click on it with
   the right mouse button.

4. Select the "_Link to controller..._" menu item (keep holding the piano key).

5. Now push the piano key harder to trigger aftertouch.

6. Click on the area below the _Phase Modulation (PM)_ virtual knob in
   JS80P's interface.

7. Select the "_Channel Aftertouch_" option.

<a name="faq-pm-fm"></a>

### Aren't Phase Modulation and Frequency Modulation equivalent? Why have both?

The reason for JS80P having both kinds of modulation is that they are not
always equivalent. They are only identical when the modulator signal is a
sinusoid, but with each added harmonic, PM and FM start to differ more and
more. A detailed mathematical explanation of this is shown in
[pm-fm-equivalence.md](pm-fm-equivalence.md).

<a name="faq-name"></a>

### Where does the name come from?

In 2022, I started developing a browser-based synthesizer using the [Web Audio
API][webaudio], mostly being inspired by the [Yamaha CS-80][cs80]. I named that
project [JS-80][js80]. Then I started adding one little feature and
customization option after the other, then it got out of hand, and I also
started finding limitations of doing audio in the browser. So I decided to
implement a cleaned up version of this synth in C++ as a DAW plugin (with a
better waveshaper antialiasing method than what's available in the browser),
and so JS80P was born.
